# ![Prybar](logo.svg)

Prybar is a universal interpreter front-end. Same interface, same
REPL, different languages.

## Why

At [Repl.it](https://repl.it), we're in the business of running REPLs.
As it happens to be, every language implements them differently. We
wanted them to all behave the same: run code and drop into a REPL!

## How it works

Prybar, written in [Go](https://golang.org/), maintains a common
command-line interface that calls into a select language backend. When
possible, the language backends are implemented using cgo and the
language's C-bindings. Otherwise, they make use of a small script
written in the host language which starts a Prybar-compatible REPL.

## Usage

    Usage: ./prybar-LANG [FLAGS] [FILENAME]...
      -I	interactive (use readline repl)
      -c string
        	execute without printing result
      -e string
        	evaluate and print result
      -i	interactive (use language repl)
      -ps1 string
        	repl prompt (default "--> ")
      -ps2 string
        	repl continuation prompt (default "... ")
      -q	don't print language version

## Build and run

    % make help
    usage:
      make all          Build all Prybar binaries
      make prybar-LANG  Build the Prybar binary for LANG
      make docker       Run a shell with Prybar inside Docker
      make image        Build a Docker image with Prybar for distribution
      make test         Run integration tests
      make test-image   Test Docker image for distribution
      make clean        Remove build artifacts
      make help         Show this message

Prybar uses Docker to make it easy to get started with development.
First, you must [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
Then, run:

    $ make docker

to create a Docker image containing the Prybar code and all of its
dependencies, and launch a shell inside of it. The Prybar source
repository will be synchronized with the working directory of the
container's filesystem, so you only need to re-run `make docker` if
you change the Dockerfile or any of its scripts.

To build Prybar (this should be done inside `make docker` unless you
have installed all of Prybar's dependencies on your system), run
`make` or `make all`. Then the `prybar-LANG` binaries will be
available in the working directory and on `$PATH`, one for each
supported language `LANG` ([see the `languages` subdirectory of this
repository](languages)):

    $ prybar-python3 -h

### Distribution

Run `make image` to create a Docker image containing not only Prybar's
dependencies and source code but also its compiled binaries, which can
be embedded inside other Docker images by means of `COPY
--from=basicer/prybar`.

This image is automatically built and deployed to [Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) every time a commit is merged to
`master`.
